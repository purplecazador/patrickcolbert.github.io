                                    <p class="vertFlexPara" id="subPara">During my Year 10 school year, I had been nominated as
                                         a student representative council 
                                        where I would act as a leader, and connection between students within my year, and 
                                        the staff members  of the school. This position 
                                        would require me to report issues that my year would have, and discuss with the 
                                        other representatives during a weekly meeting.
                                        From this position, I became a nominee to become one of the Senior School Leaders, 
                                        but unfortunately, I lost the election.

                                        and been fascinated  by them,
                                        and how they operate, and being someone who loves games, and wanted to upgrade to higher 
                                        performing hardware,
                                        I got frustrated by how limited in quality, and expensive prebuilt computers can be. From 
                                        there I decided to 
                                        save up my money to build a powerful computer that would hopefully last me for the next 
                                        decade or so. 
                                        After successfully building a computer, I gained a interest in simulating builds in online 
                                        programs, and 
                                        to have the chance to be able to build more computers would be extremely  enjoyable.

                                        In the process of picking the parts, I learned a significant amount about specific hardware 
                                        components and how they
                                        operate and interact with the system, and made me interested in how the industry will innovate
                                         computer hardware
                                        in the future, which can be seen within my "envisioning my future" essay.

                                    <p class="vertFlexPara" id="subPara">Starting in 2020, I
                                         developed a interest in watching food shows on tv and
                                        the internet, and after developing that interest, I 
                                        starting experimenting with my cooking, and new and exciting
                                        dishes for me and my family. As I continued to cook 
                                        new things, I started to learn and understand how elements of
                                        cooking changed the dishes, taste, texture, and look, 
                                        and what single ingredients  will add to a dish, if it would 
                                        add a new flavour, take over the dish, or pair with the 
                                        other ingredients . I feel that cooking closely relates
                                        to many parts of the IT industry, especially programming, 
                                        as it can be a trial and error process, and requires 
                                        a lot  skill to understand and master, but when you do make 
                                        something good, its incredibly  satisfying.

                                        <p class="vertFlexPara" id="subPara">In 2019, my high school opened up 
                                            an opportunity that I could not refuse.
                                            During my year 12 school year, multiple different one year traineeships 
                                            were offered for our year, with one of them being an IT
                                            traineeship. Being the only one to apply for it, I was 
                                            automatically awarded  the position, as well as a
                                            certificate to go with it. This was extremely  lucky for
                                             me, because I had screwed up my course selection,
                                            and I was short a subject, and resulted in me being 
                                            disqualified from receiving  an ATAR in NSW, and in 
                                            turn, I could not go to university after school. 
                                            Fortunately, this traineeship was able to give
                                            me the pathway I needed to start my study in IT.<br><br>
                                            During this traineeship, my main job was to 
                                            provide technical  support for teachers and students, 
                                            allowing me to get real world experience for 
                                            the IT industry, and experience all kind of 
                                            requirements that I needed for the industry. These included
                                            skills, like communication, problem solving, 
                                            a good work ethic, and also included required extensive knowledge 
                                             on both computer hardware and software, 
                                            and some knowledge  on networking
                                            <br><br>In the end, I came out of the traineeship 
                                            with a developed understanding  of the field of technical support
                                            and an improved set of skills that are required for the IT industry, which has helped me 
                                            significantly in my studies at university.

                                        <p class="vertFlexPara" id="subPara">During the course "Creating Coding" at Griffith University,
                                            I was given a introduction to JavaScript through using  the functions library "P5.js". From the course,
                                            we learned how to use JavaScript’s in-built functions library, as well as the P5.js's library to 
                                            create interactive programs for the user. The final assignment required the class to recreate
                                            "Missile Defence", using only JavaScript and P5.js.<br><br> This assignment  was extremely  fun,
                                            and the way that I wanted to recreate the game, was by figuring out as many functions
                                            as I could from watching  gameplay, then trying to recreate the functions as accurately as I could.
                                            Although I did not have the proper expertise, or time to implement all the functions, I did what 
                                            I could, and created a game that is reminiscent  of Missile Defence. With not being as advanced,
                                            but feels and plays like the original game. My intentions were to create a more functional and 
                                            interesting game, rather than a visually good looking one.<br><br>This experience was extremely 
                                            important  for my developing programming skill, as I was able see my flaws in my code, and what I
                                            could have done better. But also it helped grow other skills like problem solving, which was
                                            required quite often in the making of the game.
