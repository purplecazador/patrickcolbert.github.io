                                        which is a course that teaches the students how to develop a web page from scratch using HTML, CSS, and implementing 
                                        programming languages such as PHP, and JavaScript. From this course, I have developed an in-depth  knowledge 
                                        on how to effectively  use HTML and CSS to create a tangible  and engaging webpage, furthermore developing my
                                        knowledge in manipulating HTML tags with CSS and, understanding how to create a interconnected webpage 
                                        with as much efficiency  as possible.<br><br>From many workshops from the course that tested our knowledge,
                                        and understanding  of the content, I have developed the skills required to create a website for display,
                                        and this can be seen with this website that you are currently on. This website is basically a template
                                        that I created for my assignment, and I have adapted  it to fit the needs for this assignment, to 
                                        create an engaging portfolio website that is easy to navigate and learn about my development.

                                    <p class="vertFlexPara" id="subPara">From courses at Griffith University, I developed disciplinary knowledge  in
                                        Project Developments  that occur within the IT industry, specifically, I have learned extensive knowledge  on 
                                        have agile project development occurs, and more so the process of how agile development is completed, 
                                        and extensive knowledge  on the documentation required.<br><br> This knowledge  was built from many quizzes, 
                                        workshops and lectures, and through multiple group based assignments. These assignments were crucial  in 
                                        developing my understanding, as they required extensive research and consideration to properly 
                                        understand each stage of project development  and the planning that is required as well. Furthermore,
                                        being a group assignment, I've managed to learn and develop my skills in communication and group 
                                        interactions, and the experience of working with others in a pseudo-professional environment is

                                    <p class="vertFlexPara" id="subPara">Throughout my education, python has been the most prevalent language 
                                        that I have been taught, being one of the most popular, and used languages in the recent years.
                                        I developed my skill in python firstly in school, where I was first introduced to it. There we had 
                                        learned the basics of python through the website known as "Grok", where we went through the basics
                                        and intermediate logic of python, and furthermore, we were given access to 'competitions',
                                        where multiple problems were released per week, and the participants were required to create their
                                        own solution. This gave a competitive aspect to the classes, and helped developed and hone my logic,
                                        and programming skills in the process, allowing me to bring that knowledge and skill into other 
                                        languages and situations.

                                    <p class="vertFlexPara" id="subPara">During my studies at Griffith, the course "Computer Systems and 
                                        Networks", taught me about how processing works in computers, and how the architecture of 
                                        processors allow computers to do what they do. In the process, we learned about how data flows
                                        through the hardware components, and the different  gates that manipulate  the data within logic circuits
                                        with OR gates,
                                        AND gates, and NOT gates being the basic three that are the most commonly used. Using these gates,
                                        the course's assignment required me to create a logic circuit for an elevator that is restricted
                                        to certain floors, with other parameters.<br><br> From this course, I've developed a deep understanding
                                        of processors, and developed a understanding, and new skill in logic circuit design, allowing me
                                        to create circuits that manipulate  input data to a specific required output.

                                    <p class="vertFlexPara" id="subPara">Communication and Teamwork is a major skill that is required for 
                                        the IT industry, and since starting my studies at Griffith, its easy to see that each course
                                        has elements that are specifically present to use and develop these skills, being in either
                                        assignments, tasks, or workshops, and require good communication and teamwork to complete.
                                        <br><br>From all the courses so far, they have helped me become more cooperative with others, 
                                        and I tend to become the voice of the group, especially when on an online setting, where sometimes
                                        people dont talk much. I've improved my communication, and have been able to share my ideas with
                                        more confidence than before, making tasks completion faster, and easier.

                                        the industry, and its can been seen in university, where plenty of subjects require problem
                                        solving to complete projects, especially with learning programming languages, and IT project 
                                        development, where its all about using problem solving, to create a solution for a problem.
                                        From studies in both high school, and university, I have been able to drastically improve
                                        my problem solving skills, through plenty of programming problems, and solutions that I must
                                        create for any IT problems that arise. Furthermore, from my experience from a IT traineeship
                                        problems come up on the fly, and being able to find or create a appropriate solution is
                                        important to swiftly fix that issue for a client. Due to this, it's forced me to be able
                                        to think quicky about past and new solutions for a problem.
