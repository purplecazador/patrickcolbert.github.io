                    </div>
                    <div class="flexVertTypeOne" id="paragraph">
                        <h1 class="vertFlexParaStart" id="aboutMeParaStart">My passion in IT compels me to contribute something 
                            great to the industry, and this portfolio will be a documentation of all that I have accomplished 
                            along the way!
                        </h1>

                        <p class="vertFlexPara" id="aboutMePara">When I was young, I never had proper motivation, and that left me lost with what I wanted for my future. But, because of how computers had become very prevalent, my high school started mandatory subjects that taught the basic understandings of computers and technology, and this finally sparked the motivation that I needed to launch myself into something that I ultimately enjoyed learning about computer technology. It really made me appreciate computers being in most of my life and I began thinking what I could do to contribute to its development.
                            
                            <!--From there, I chose any kind of technology subject that was available in school, growing my facination with
                            computers and the IT industry.-->
                            <br><br>
                            After graduating, my high school offered a one-year IT traineeship, and being the only person to apply for it, I was automatically chosen for the role. This was a major step for my development, as I was given a hands-on approach of the IT industry, and in turn, I learned the basics of troubleshooting with technical support, computer repair, networking, and software operation. I was also very lucky, as the traineeship kept me employed with a steady income during the first year of the Covid pandemic, and supplied me with a TAFE Certificate, which gave options for my future.
                            <br><br>
                            After finally deciding what I wanted from myself, I applied for university, and was accepted by Griffith to study a Bachelor of Information Technology online. This journey so far has filled me with confidence on what I want out of my future, and when I look back at all the opportunities I was given, I feel lucky and glad that I chose to peruse those opportunities for myself, and that I will be able to make something of myself in the industry.
                            <br><br>
                            This portfolio will become the documentation of my journey, and will contain my achievements, growth, and everything that I have learned.
                            <br>
                            As I develop myself, so will this portfolio.
                            <br><br>
                            For future clients and employers, this will be your first impression of me, and I implore you explore my achievements and career, to understand who I am as a person, including ideals and values.
