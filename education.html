                                        <p class="vertFlexPara" id="subPara">I chose to study Information Technology because since high school,
                                            I've developed a love of computers and everything about them, the hardware and software, network communications,
                                            programming and a whole lot more that was introduced to me in school. I knew that if studied IT, it
                                            would give me a taste of every part of the IT industry, not just a single aspect, and I knew it would
                                            help me understand what part of the industry I would enjoy the most and work towards for a career.
                                            <br><br>
                                            I've decided to pursue a Major in Networks and Security, as I've always been 
                                            fascinated  about how computers are able to communicate data from one another, and at such long
                                            distances in a split second. Getting the opportunity to learn all about networking, and how 
                                            security plays a part in keeping data safe, is a great opportunity for me, and I hope to use it as 
                                            a pathway for a career in networking and security. Unfortunately, Griffith does not seem to supply any
                                            minors for IT, so I am unfortunately unable to complete one.

                                                was this Certificate III of Education Support. <br><br> To complete this certificate, it required me to 
                                                enter active classrooms and monitor, assist and gain a deeper understanding of both students
                                                and teachers in the classroom. Furthermore, I was required to complete a range of questions 
                                                relating to the subject of supporting the classroom in assistance of the teacher, with safety
                                                questions, conduct questions, and plenty more. <br><br>I completed these questions to a good result
                                                within the year that I was instructed to do so. Also, inbetween completing my duties of an IT trainee, I 
                                                would be sent into certain classrooms to complete the above requirements, and in turn, I would be
                                                lead by the teacher for how I should interact with the students, and what was required of me.
                                                The result of the Certificate was a success in allowing me to develop the skills required within
                                                the classroom, and the knowledge  to keep the classroom a safe and secure place. Furthermore, I've
                                                developed personal attributes of being assertive, and confident in my decision, especially in the
                                                classroom, and develop the skill to understand how others are feeling and thinking within a learning
                                                environment.
